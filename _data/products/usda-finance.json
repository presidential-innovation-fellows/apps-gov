    "long_description": "The National Finance Center (NFC) is a designated Shared Services Center under the Federal Information Technology Shared Services and OPM’s Human Resources Line of Business initiatives. These initiatives require Federal agencies to use a shared approach to service delivery.<br/><br/>NFC’s hosting services provide a secure multi-tenant community cloud. Hosting customers leverage the NFC Data Center Services framework in its entirety, and may selectively implement one or more of the non-core services based on their individual business needs, and operational and financial imperatives. Within each of the non-core services, customers can choose a fully-configured service architecture from the outset, or start with a basic configuration and adapt and expand as necessary.<br/><br/>NFC’s PaaS consists of NFC’s IT Infrastructure of hardware, operating systems, storage, network capacity, and the physically secure data centers.  This infrastructure is partitioned into the following general support systems (GSS), Enterprise Infrastructure, Mainframe, and Midrange.  The Enterprise Infrastructure (EI) consists of the network and data center components.  The Mainframe and Midrange provide the computer-processing capability.",
